# Dev Environment

Documentation for the staging environment used during the Three.js 3D map migration.

---

## Overview

The project has two deployment environments:

| Environment | Branch | URL | Purpose |
|-------------|--------|-----|---------|
| Production | `main` | [nczoning.net](https://nczoning.net) | Live site — always fully functional |
| Staging | `dev` | [dev.nczoning.net](https://dev.nczoning.net) | In-progress Three.js work — may be incomplete |

Production deploys via GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.
Staging deploys via Cloudflare Pages Git integration on every push to `dev`.

---

## Branch Strategy

```
main ──────────────────────────────────────────────────► (live site)
  └── dev ──────────────────────────────────────────────► (staging)
        ├── feat/three-js-phase-1 ──► PR → dev
        ├── feat/three-js-phase-2 ──► PR → dev
        └── ...
              (all phases complete)
                    └── dev ──► PR → main
```

- **Phase feature branches** (e.g. `feat/three-js-phase-1`) branch off `dev` and PR back into `dev`
- `main` is only touched when a complete, fully-tested feature is ready to ship
- `dev` may be broken or incomplete at any point — that's expected

---

## Cloudflare Pages Setup

The staging deployment is hosted on Cloudflare Pages under the project `nc-zoning-board-dev`.

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Platform | Cloudflare Pages |
| Project name | `nc-zoning-board-dev` |
| Connected repository | `spuddeh/nc-zoning-board` |
| Production branch | `dev` |
| Build command | `node scripts/build_mods.js` |
| Build output directory | `/` |
| Custom domain | `dev.nczoning.net` |

No GitHub Actions secrets or API tokens are required. Cloudflare's native Git integration authenticates directly with GitHub and triggers builds automatically on every push to `dev`.

### What happens on push to `dev`

1. Cloudflare detects the push via GitHub webhook
2. Clones the repository at the pushed commit
3. Runs `npm clean-install` (installs dependencies from `package.json`)
4. Runs `node scripts/build_mods.js` — generates `mods.json` from `data/locations/*.json`
5. Uploads all files (including the generated `mods.json`) to Cloudflare's global network
6. Site is live at `dev.nczoning.net` within ~60 seconds of pushing

### Cloudflare Pages dashboard

**Build > Compute > Workers & Pages → nc-zoning-board-dev**

This is where you can:
- View build logs for each deployment
- Manually trigger a deployment
- Manage the custom domain
- Roll back to a previous deployment if needed

## Development Workflow

### Starting a new phase

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout -b feat/three-js-phase-N
```

### Finishing a phase

1. Push the feature branch to GitHub
2. Open a PR targeting `dev` (not `main`)
3. Verify the preview looks correct locally with `npx serve .` after running `node scripts/build_mods.js`
4. Merge the PR into `dev`
5. Cloudflare automatically deploys — verify at `dev.nczoning.net`

### Keeping dev in sync with main

When bugfixes or data updates land on `main`, merge them into `dev` to stay current:

```bash
git checkout dev
git merge main
git push
```

Do this periodically, especially after any data backfill PRs merge to `main`.

### Shipping to production

Once all phases of the Three.js migration are complete and verified on `dev.nczoning.net`:

1. Open a PR from `dev` → `main`
2. Merge — GitHub Actions deploys to `nczoning.net` automatically

---

## Local Development

Always rebuild `mods.json` before running the local server, otherwise you may be testing against stale data:

```bash
node scripts/build_mods.js
npx serve .
```

`mods.json` is gitignored and is never committed — it is built fresh on every Cloudflare deploy and must be built manually for local testing.

---

## Relationship to the Three.js Migration

The `dev` branch exists specifically to support the Three.js 3D map migration (documented in [`three-js-migration-plan.md`](three-js-migration-plan.md)). Each phase of the migration ships as a PR into `dev`. The full feature will not touch `main` until all phases are complete and verified.

Current phase status is tracked in [`three-js-scene.md`](three-js-scene.md).
