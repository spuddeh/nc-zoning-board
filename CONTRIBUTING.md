# Contributing to NC Zoning Board

Thanks for wanting to help! There are a few different ways to contribute depending on your skills.

---

## 🗺️ Submitting a Mod Location

### Preferred: NCZoning Auto-Discovery

Add your mod directly from Nexus — no GitHub required. Tag your mod with **NCZoning**, then use the **[+] Submit** button on the map to generate and paste a metadata block into your mod description.

See **[docs/nczoning-auto-discovery.md](docs/nczoning-auto-discovery.md)** for full instructions.

### Alternative: GitHub Issue

For a permanent, manually curated entry. See **[docs/adding-mods.md](docs/adding-mods.md)** for full instructions.

**Short version:**

1. Get your in-game coordinates from the CET console: `print(GetPlayer():GetWorldPosition())`
2. Go to [Issues → New Issue → 📍 Submit a New Mod Location](https://github.com/spuddeh/nc-zoning-board/issues/new/choose)
3. Fill in the form — the bot creates a PR automatically
4. A maintainer reviews and merges it → your pin appears on the live map

> **No Git knowledge required** for either method.

## 🛠️ Contributing Code or Docs

### Getting Started

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nc-zoning-board.git
cd nc-zoning-board

# Run locally
npx serve .
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Project Structure

```text
index.html              # Entry point
assets/
  js/app.js             # Map logic (Leaflet, pins, popups)
  css/style.css         # Cyberpunk-themed styles
data/
  locations/            # Individual mod JSON files
  tags.json             # Global tag registry
mods.json               # Compiled mod registry (Git ignored)
mods.schema.json        # JSON Schema for validation
scripts/
  build_mods.js         # Compiles data/locations/*.json -> mods.json
  validate_tags.js      # Validates used tags against tags.json
  generate_tiles.js     # Map tile generator (Node.js + sharp)
docs/                   # Architecture, guides, coordinate system
.github/
  workflows/            # CI/CD — validation, submission, deployment
  ISSUE_TEMPLATE/       # Mod submission form
```

### Before Opening a PR

Just do a quick sanity check:

- Run `node scripts/build_mods.js` to compile data
- Run `node scripts/validate_tags.js` to check tag validity
- If you changed map/coordinate stuff, verify pins still render correctly
- Keep it focused — one feature or fix per PR

If something breaks, let us know! We can debug together.

## 🤝 Ways to Help

This is a community passion project built by modders helping each other. If you've got some spare time and want to contribute — great! No pressure if you can't. Here are the areas where help would be awesome:

### 🖥️ Frontend & Web

Like building websites? We're working on district overlays, improving pin clustering, custom Cyberpunk-themed icons, and general UI polish. You'd work with Leaflet.js and vanilla JS/CSS.

### ⚙️ DevOps & Automation

Comfortable with GitHub Actions? We maintain the submission workflow, tile generation, deployment pipeline, and Discord webhook integrations. Node.js + YAML.

### 🎨 Design & Polish

Into icon design or dark-theme UI? We'd love Cyberpunk-style custom pins, visual consistency, and overall aesthetic improvements.

### ✍️ Documentation & Writing

Help keep docs/ current, write guides for new contributors, or clarify existing docs. Markdown + basic Git knowledge.

**Want to help?** Join the **[Locations Hub Discord](https://discord.gg/sc4yEx2fNf)** and say hi in the general channel — we'd love to chat about what you're interested in!

## 📌 Code Standards

- **JavaScript:** Vanilla ES6+, no build step, no frameworks
- **CSS:** Plain CSS — keep the Cyberpunk aesthetic (Orbitron/Rajdhani fonts, dark theme)
- **JSON:** All `mods.json` entries must pass schema validation
- **Commit messages:** Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`)
