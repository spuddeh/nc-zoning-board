# Nexus Mods V2 GraphQL API Reference

This document covers the Nexus Mods GraphQL API implementation used by NC Zoning Board: the two queries we use, the limitations of the public API, caching strategy, and known risks.

## Overview

**Endpoint:** `https://api.nexusmods.com/v2/graphql`

**Official Documentation:** https://graphql.nexusmods.com/

**Authentication:** None required. The V2 API returns only public mod data; no credentials are needed.

**Status:** ⚠️ **Technically Unsupported**

The V2 API is not officially supported by Nexus Mods. Per direct conversation with Nexus Mods staff (Pickysaurus), they intend to eventually migrate back to REST. If that happens, [`services.js`](../assets/js/services.js) will need updates. Monitor [Nexus announcements](https://www.nexusmods.com) for any API retirement notices.

**Rate Limits:** No rate limits are publicly documented, and none have been encountered in practice.

## Queries Used

### 1. `modsByUid` — Thumbnail Fetch for Manual Mods

**Purpose:** Fetches featured images (`pictureUrl`, `thumbnailUrl`) for manually registered mods.

**Query:**

```graphql
query modsByUid($uids: [ID!]!, $count: Int!) {
  modsByUid(uids: $uids, count: $count) {
    nodes {
      modId
      pictureUrl
      thumbnailUrl
      updatedAt
    }
  }
}
```

**Input Variables:**
- `uids` — Array of composite Nexus UIDs (see UID Construction below)
- `count` — **Must equal the number of UIDs requested** ⚠️

**UID Construction:**

Nexus V2 uses a composite BigInt UID format. From [`constants.js`](../assets/js/constants.js), the conversion is:

```javascript
toNexusUid(modId) {
  return (BigInt(3333) << BigInt(32)) + BigInt(modId)
}.toString()
```

Where `3333` is the game ID for Cyberpunk 2077.

**Output Fields per Node:**
- `modId` — The numeric Nexus mod ID
- `pictureUrl` — URL to the featured image (full resolution)
- `thumbnailUrl` — URL to a thumbnail version of the featured image
- `updatedAt` — ISO 8601 timestamp of the mod's last update on Nexus; used to drive the recently-updated badge

**Pagination:** None. All UIDs are sent in a single request.

**⚠️ Silent Result Cap (Fixed 2026-03-13):**

If the `count` variable is omitted or not explicitly passed, the Nexus API silently returns only the first 20 results regardless of how many UIDs you request. This caused a bug where only 20 mod thumbnails would load. **Always pass `count: validIds.length`** to ensure all requested images are returned.

**Caching:**
- Cache key: `nc_nexus_thumbs`
- TTL: 24 hours
- Strategy: Incremental — checks which IDs are cached, fetches only missing ones, merges result with existing cache before re-saving

**Implementation:** [`fetchNexusThumbnails()` in services.js](../assets/js/services.js)

### 2. `NCZoningMods` (`mods`) — Auto-Discovery Query

**Purpose:** Finds all mods on Nexus Mods for Cyberpunk 2077 that have been tagged `NCZoning` by their authors. These mods' descriptions are parsed for an `[NCZoning]` metadata block.

**Query:**

```graphql
query NCZoningMods($filter: ModsFilter!, $count: Int!, $offset: Int!) {
  mods(filter: $filter, count: $count, offset: $offset) {
    nodes {
      modId
      name
      summary
      description
      pictureUrl
      thumbnailUrl
      updatedAt
      uploader {
        name
      }
    }
    totalCount
  }
}
```

**Input Variables:**
- `filter.gameId` — `[{ value: "3333" }]` (Cyberpunk 2077)
- `filter.tag` — `[{ value: "NCZoning" }]`
- `count` — Results per page (see Pagination below)
- `offset` — Current page offset

**Output Fields per Node:**
- `modId` — Numeric Nexus mod ID
- `name` — Mod title
- `summary` — Short description; used as the pin popup description (truncated to 500 chars)
- `description` — Full mod description; parsed for `[NCZoning]` metadata block
- `pictureUrl` — Featured image URL (full resolution)
- `thumbnailUrl` — Featured image thumbnail URL
- `updatedAt` — ISO 8601 timestamp of the mod's last update on Nexus; used to drive the recently-updated badge
- `uploader.name` — Nexus username of the mod author (used as first author)
- `totalCount` — Total number of mods matching the filter (used for pagination loop)

**Pagination: Offset-Based (Undocumented)**

The Nexus API does not document pagination for the `mods` query, but it supports offset-based paging:

- Page size: 50 mods per request (`NCZ.NEXUS_BATCH_SIZE`)
- Loop: `while (offset < totalCount)`
- Exit conditions:
  - `nodes.length === 0` (empty page)
  - `nodes.length < COUNT` (short final page)
  - `page` is absent from response
  - Network or parse error

**Caching:**
- Cache key: `nc_nexus_autodiscovery`
- TTL: 10 minutes
- Strategy: Full result set cached; re-filtered against current manual entries on every cache hit to suppress duplicates without waiting for expiry

**Post-Fetch Processing:**
1. For mods whose `modId` already exists in manual `mods.json`: collect `pictureUrl`, `thumbnailUrl`, and `updatedAt` into a `meta` map keyed by `nexusId`, then skip (manual entry wins for all other data)
2. Parse `node.description` for `[NCZoning]` metadata block (see [`parseNcZoningBlock()`](../assets/js/utils.js) in utils.js)
3. If block missing or invalid, skip the mod with a log message
4. Construct authors array: Nexus uploader name + any additional authors from the block
5. Truncate `summary` to 500 characters for the popup description
6. Prepend `"nczoning"` tag automatically (identifies auto-discovered mods in the UI)
7. Store `updatedAt` as `_updatedAt` on the mod object — if within `NCZ.RECENTLY_UPDATED_DAYS` days, an `UPDATED` badge is shown in the popup, sidebar, and cluster flyout

The function returns `{ mods, meta }` where `meta` contains image/timestamp data for manually registered mods that are also NCZoning-tagged. In `app.js`, `meta` is merged into `nexusThumbs` so those manual mods receive their thumbnails and `_updatedAt` without a separate `modsByUid` call. Mods covered by `meta` are excluded from the `modsByUid` batch.

**Implementation:** [`fetchNexusTaggedMods()` in services.js](../assets/js/services.js)

## Image Availability Limitation ⚠️

**Only the featured/header image is available via the public API — for now.**

Both `modsByUid()` and `mods()` queries return only:
- `pictureUrl` — the mod's featured image (full resolution)
- `thumbnailUrl` — a thumbnail-sized version of the same featured image

**Full mod image galleries are NOT currently accessible** without authenticated/private API access.

This limitation has been **confirmed directly with Nexus Mods staff (Pickysaurus)**. Per Pickysaurus, featured image only is a "for now" limitation — full mod image galleries may be added to the public API in the future.

**Current design implication:** The UI can only display the single featured image per mod from Nexus. Manual mod entries can link to external image galleries in their `description` field or credits if needed.

---

## Caching Strategy

Both API calls use browser `localStorage` for caching via `cacheGet()`/`cacheSet()` helpers in [`utils.js`](../assets/js/utils.js).

| Cache Key | TTL | What's Stored | Merge Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `nc_nexus_thumbs` | 24 hours | Map of `nexus_id → { pictureUrl, thumbnailUrl }` | Incremental — only missing IDs fetched |
| `nc_nexus_autodiscovery` | 10 minutes | `{ mods: [...], meta: { nexusId → { pictureUrl, thumbnailUrl, updatedAt } } }` | Full replacement — re-filtered on read; backwards-compatible with old array format |

### Cache Envelope

Both caches use a `{ ts, data }` envelope:
```javascript
{ ts: <timestamp-ms>, data: <cached-value> }
```

On read, `Date.now() - ts > ttl` determines expiry.

## Error Handling

**`modsByUid` (Thumbnail Fetch):**
- Network/parse errors → `console.warn()` + return empty object `{}`
- No retry logic

**`mods` (Auto-Discovery):**
- GraphQL errors in response → logged with `console.warn()`, loop continues collecting partial results
- Network/parse errors → logged with `console.warn()`, loop stops
- Partial results are still cached and returned

**No automatic retries** are implemented for either query. Transient failures silently return whatever was collected before the error.

---

## Known Risks & Future Considerations

1. **API Retirement Risk:** V2 is unsupported. Monitor for Nexus announcements of REST migration.
2. **Undocumented Pagination:** The `mods` query's offset-based pagination is not documented. Page size and behavior may change without notice.
3. **No Retry Logic:** Transient network failures don't trigger retries; silent partial results are returned.
4. **Image URLs:** If Nexus changes URL formats or removes images, thumbnails will break without warning.
5. **Image Galleries (Future):** Full mod image galleries may be added to the public API in the future (per Pickysaurus). When that happens, the thumbnail fetch and auto-discovery queries should be revisited to consider caching and displaying gallery images.
